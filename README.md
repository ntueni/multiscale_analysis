This project was started by Nicole Tueni ca. 2019

FEniCS script for computational homogenization of 2D/3D periodic unit cells with two elastic phases. 
Applies elementary macroscopic strains, solves for displacement fluctuations with periodic BCs, computes effective stiffness tensor, and exports displacement/stress fields.


1) Install prerequisites
